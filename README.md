# iois-web-seed
A quick start seed for a web application using io.js

## Concept
* Have a complete application using the full stack
* Comment out several parts to make it just a seed
* Comment back in and explain what it does to application

## Server stack
* io.js
* hapi
* handlebars (react as an optional replacement)
* mongoose

## Client stack
* jQuery
* bootstrap
* optionally react

## Workshop style
* Two parts
* In part one we introduce the technology stack
* In part two participants install the application and choose one of the assignments for on technology
* Participants can use resources, coaches, and other participants to accomplish assignments
* It is recommended to pair on an assignment

### Part one
* 5 min: Each one introduces her/himself to neighbor 
* form teams

### Part two
* Fork this project on github and clone it
* Install io.js
* Install Mongo
* npm install
* npm start
* use IDE/editor of your choice (use WebStorm or Atom, if you just do not know what to use)
* mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf

## Possible projects
### Quick Rant Generator
* Add name of shitty tool, software, technique, technology
* Check appropriate boxes (buggy, complicated as hell, no backward compatibility, etc.)
* Generate rant
    * Store to mongo
    * Generate public link for it to share
